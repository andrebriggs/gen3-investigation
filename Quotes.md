On Gen3 roadmap:
> "They do have them, but it's it's not public unfortunately. While the code is open source, the development artifacts and the commitment to a community is still not quite there. They're talking about, and they're working on it. But you know, there it's been an internal project that they've opened up to the world to use. They're not as open in terms of the whole road map, and you know the contributions."

On the slow PR acceptance rate: 
> "And it's we talked about it. Their problem is that they have all this automated testing that won't kick off if it's an external person that does the PR."

ON communicating via Slack channel
> "Yeah, we have oh absolutely with several people. They're very open. There are awesome to work with. Um, in fact, if I criticize myself, which I do all the time. But one thing I don't do enough is contact them all, run into some kind of a problem and I'll spend you know three or four days or a week beating my head against the table running. What am I doing wrong? And I'll contact them on the Slack channel. Let's say, Oh yeah, there was a change you need to put this in that file. You probably didn't know that their documentation is not. It's not job one, their documentation."
